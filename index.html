				<h2 id="history">History</h2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; The Department of Agriculture (DA) in the Philippines has a rich history intertwined with the country's agricultural development. Here's a brief overview:</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; 1. American Colonial Period (1898-1946): During the American colonial era, agricultural policies were established to promote land tenure and agricultural education. The Bureau of Agriculture, precursor to the DA, was created in 1898. It focused on improving farming methods, introducing new crops, and enhancing agricultural education.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; 2. Post-Independence Era (1946-1972): After gaining independence in 1946, the Philippine government continued to prioritize agricultural development. The Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) was established in 1947, merging several agencies including the Bureau of Agriculture. DANR aimed to address the country's agricultural challenges and boost productivity.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; 3. Martial Law Period (1972-1986): The martial law period under President Ferdinand Marcos saw significant changes in agricultural policies. The Department of Agriculture and Food (DAF) was formed in 1974 through the integration of DANR and the Department of Agrarian Reform. This period witnessed the Green Revolution initiatives, which aimed to increase agricultural productivity through the adoption of modern technologies and high-yielding crop varieties.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; 4. Post-Martial Law and Contemporary Era (1986-Present): After the ousting of Marcos in 1986, the Department of Agriculture (DA) was reestablished. Since then, the DA has undergone various reforms and initiatives to address the evolving needs of the agricultural sector. These include programs for rural development, sustainable agriculture, agrarian reform, and food security.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; Throughout its history, the Department of Agriculture has faced challenges such as land reform issues, natural disasters, and global market fluctuations. However, it continues to play a vital role in promoting agricultural growth, ensuring food security, and improving the livelihoods of Filipino farmers and rural communities.</p><br>
